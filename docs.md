Settlement and Integration Services
Helping French-speaking newcomers thrive in Alberta
At La Bonne Semence Francophone Society, we understand the challenges that come with starting over in a new country. Our Settlement and Integration Services are designed to support French-speaking newcomers as they navigate their new lives in Alberta.
We provide personalized, culturally relevant support to help individuals and families feel welcomed, informed, and empowered.

What We Offer

We offer group and one-on-one sessions that introduce newcomers to life in Alberta. Topics include understanding Canadian systems, accessing healthcare, education, transportation, and knowing your rights and responsibilities as a resident.
Employment and Job Readiness Support
We help participants explore job opportunities, build résumés, prepare for interviews, and access training programs. We also connect clients with local employers and employment agencies that support bilingual or francophone workers.
Housing Support
Navigating rental systems or purchasing a home can be overwhelming. We assist with finding affordable housing, understanding leases and tenant rights, and connecting with housing support organizations.
Language Navigation Services
We help French-speaking newcomers access services in their preferred language, providing interpretation support where necessary, and helping bridge gaps when dealing with English-speaking institutions.
